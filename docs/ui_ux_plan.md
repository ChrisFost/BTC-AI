#### Parameter Management Implementation Plan

**Objective**: Create a robust system for managing training parameters through the existing UI structure.

**Core Features**:
1. Custom parameter preset saving/loading
2. Preset management interface
3. Parameter performance tracking
4. Integration with existing UI patterns

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Add custom preset storage infrastructure
   - Create preset directory structure
   - Implement JSON-based storage format
   - Add metadata tracking (creation date, description, etc.)

2. Develop core parameter management functions:
   ```python
   def save_custom_preset(name, values, bucket):
       """Save current configuration as a custom preset."""
       # Create dictionary of important parameters
       # Add metadata (bucket type, timestamp, etc.)
       # Save to JSON file

   def load_custom_preset(window, values, preset_name):
       """Load a custom preset."""
       # Load preset from storage
       # Update UI elements with preset values
       # Handle bucket switching if needed

   def delete_custom_preset(preset_name):
       """Delete a custom preset."""
       # Remove preset from storage
       # Update UI elements
   ```

3. Create Parameter Presets tab with sections:
   - Available Presets (system & custom)
   - Create New Preset
   - Preset Details
   - Performance History

4. Add UI event handling:
   - System preset loading
   - Custom preset management
   - "Save as Preset" functionality from main menu
   - Preset selection and application

5. Integrate with bucket system:

```json
{
  "Preset Name": {
    "WINDOW_SIZE": 144,
    "LEARNING_RATE": 0.0003,
    // Other parameters
    "_bucket": "Scalping",
    "_created": "2023-06-15 14:30:22",
    "_description": "Optimized for high-frequency trading"
  }
}
```

**User Workflow**:
1. Configure parameters in various tabs
