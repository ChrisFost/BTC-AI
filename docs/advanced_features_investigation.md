Okay, here is the consolidated document summarizing the findings from all our investigations and the resulting action plan based on Option 2 (UI Baseline -> Dynamic Autonomy).

**Document: Findings & Plan for Autonomous Advanced Features (Option 2: UI Baseline)**

**1. Goal:**

Modify the system so that advanced natural learning and prediction features operate autonomously based on internal logic and performance *after* being initialized with baseline values/states set by the user via the existing UI controls. This preserves the UI layout and minimizes immediate config system changes while enabling the intended dynamic behavior for implemented features.

**2. Scope:**

*   **Features Targeted for Autonomy (Post-Initialization):**
    *   Adaptive Exploration Rate
    *   Experience Prioritization (via Prioritized Experience Replay - PER)
    *   Meta-Learning (Hyperparameter Optimization)
    *   Contextual Memory
    *   Post-Trade Analysis
*   **Features Where UI Settings Are Currently Unused (No Backend Changes Needed Now):**
    *   Probabilistic Prediction Engine (Static Confidence/Uncertainty Thresholds)
    *   Dynamic Prediction Horizons (Adaptation Rate, Min/Max, Distribution Mode)
*   **Features/Logic Excluded or Targeted for Removal:**
    *   Cross-Bucket Knowledge Transfer (Excluded from this plan).
    *   Teacher/Student Distillation (To be removed from `src/agent/agent.py`).

**3. Summary of Investigation Findings:**

*   **UI Controls (`src/ui/tabs.py`):** The UI provides numerous controls (checkboxes, inputs, sliders) allowing users to toggle features on/off and set specific parameters (e.g., exploration rates, PER alpha/beta, meta-learning interval, confidence thresholds, horizon adaptation rates). This creates a potential conflict if these features are meant to be fully autonomous.
*   **Agent Implementation (`src/agent/agent.py`):**
    *   The `PPOAgent` class reads configuration flags (`use_...`) and initial parameters (e.g., `INITIAL_EXPLORATION`, `MIN_EXPLORATION`, `REPLAY_ALPHA`, `REPLAY_BETA`) during its `__init__` method, matching the UI settings' intent for providing initial baselines/enabling features.
    *   Crucially, the agent *already contains implementations* for several dynamic/autonomous behaviors, gated by the `use_...` flags read at initialization:
        *   **Adaptive Exploration:** `_get_exploration_factor()` calculates an exploration factor dynamically based on recent rewards, prediction confidence history, and market regime estimates. This dynamically calculated factor is used in `select_action`.
        *   **Experience Prioritization:** Uses `PrioritizedReplayBuffer` if `use_surprise_based_replay` is true, which inherently prioritizes samples based on calculated surprise/error. Beta parameter likely adapts internally via scheduling.
        *   **Meta-Learning:** Uses `HyperparamOptimizer` class (if `use_meta_learning` is true) to suggest hyperparameter adjustments based on performance history. The `adapt_hyperparameters` method applies these suggestions. **Finding:** This method currently modifies the `self.config` dictionary directly at runtime.
        *   **Contextual Memory & Post-Trade Analysis:** Logic for these features exists and appears to run based on the `use_contextual_memory` and `use_post_trade_analysis` flags set during initialization.
    *   **Archaic Code:** The file contains `TeacherStudentDistillation` class/references, identified as outdated.
*   **Model Implementation (`src/models/models.py`):**
    *   The `ActorCritic` model initializes prediction horizons based on the `horizon_config` argument passed during creation (likely determined by the training script/bucket type).
    *   It reads a `USE_DYNAMIC_HORIZONS` flag (defaulting True) but no logic using this flag for *adaptation* was found within the model itself.
    *   It includes prediction heads for means, standard deviations, and confidence values, making probabilistic outputs available.
*   **Confidence Thresholds (Targeted Search):** No code was found in `agent.py`, `environment`, or `training` directories that utilizes the static config keys `PROBABILISTIC_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` or `PROBABILISTIC_UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD`. The agent *does* use prediction confidence history dynamically to influence exploration.
*   **Dynamic Horizon Adaptation (Targeted Search):** No code was found referencing the `adapt_prediction_horizons` function mentioned in older documentation, nor any usage of config keys like `HORIZON_ADAPTATION_RATE`, `MIN_PREDICTION_HORIZON`, etc. The `USE_DYNAMIC_HORIZONS` flag read by the model does not appear connected to any active adaptation mechanism.
*   **Context (`v2` Files):** User confirmed `agent_v2.py`, `utils_v2.py` references in documentation map to the current `src/agent/agent.py` and `src/utils/utils.py` respectively, confirming findings.

**4. Consolidated Conclusions:**

*   The core requirement for Option 2 (Initialize from UI, then run dynamically) is **already partially met** for several key natural learning features (Adaptive Exploration, PER, Meta-Learning, Contextual Memory, Post-Trade Analysis). They are gated by flags read from config at init and have dynamic logic implemented.
*   The static UI settings for **Probabilistic Confidence/Uncertainty Thresholds** are **currently unused** by the backend. The system relies on dynamic confidence usage for exploration adjustment.
*   The dynamic **adaptation** logic for **Prediction Horizons** appears **unimplemented or disconnected**, despite the UI controls and the flag in the model. The horizons remain static based on their initial configuration. The related UI controls are effectively unused.
*   The primary backend change needed to fully align with Option 2 is to **prevent the Meta-Learning component from modifying the shared `self.config` dictionary at runtime**.
*   Archaic code (`TeacherStudentDistillation`) needs to be removed.

**5. Refined Action Plan (Implementing Option 2):**

The plan focuses almost entirely on `src/agent/agent.py`:

1.  **Modify Meta-Learning Behavior (`src/agent/agent.py`):**
    *   Locate the `adapt_hyperparameters` method within the `PPOAgent` class.
    *   Identify lines that modify `self.config` directly (e.g., `self.config[param] = value`).
    *   Change these lines to update the relevant *agent attributes* or *optimizer parameters* directly.
        *   Example for Learning Rate: Ensure `param_group['lr'] = new_lr` is done, but remove `self.config["LEARNING_RATE"] = new_lr`.
        *   Example for other params (e.g., `ENTROPY_COEF`): Change `self.config[param] = value` to `setattr(self, param.lower(), value)` or update the specific attribute used by the agent's logic (e.g., `self.entropy_coef = value`). Find where these attributes (like `self.entropy_coef`) are actually used in calculations (e.g., in the `update` method) and ensure the update targets the correct attribute.
2.  **Verify Dynamic Exploration (`src/agent/agent.py`):**
    *   Briefly review the `_get_exploration_factor` method again to confirm that config values like `self.min_exploration` are only used as boundary conditions and the core calculation relies on dynamic internal state (rewards, confidence, regime). *This seems correct based on initial review, just needs final confirmation.*
3.  **Remove Archaic Code (`src/agent/agent.py`):**
    *   Search for the class definition `TeacherStudentDistillation`. Delete the entire class definition.
    *   Search for any instantiation or method calls related to this class (e.g., `self.distillation = TeacherStudentDistillation(...)`, `self.distill_knowledge(...)`). Delete these lines.
4.  **No Backend Changes Needed For:**
    *   Confidence/Uncertainty Thresholds (UI controls unused).
    *   Dynamic Horizon Adaptation (Adaptation logic unimplemented/disconnected; UI controls unused).

**6. Next Steps:**

Implement the specific code changes outlined in the Refined Action Plan (Steps 1 and 3) within `src/agent/agent.py`.
