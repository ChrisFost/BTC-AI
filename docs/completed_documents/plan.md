# BTC-AI Project Plan

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Development and Testing Guidelines ⚠️

**CRITICAL RULE**: When modifying existing code, especially core scripts:
1. Any removal or replacement of code must be justified and reviewed carefully
2. Demonstrate that the new code maintains or improves existing functionality
3. If replacing a code block, explain how the new code preserves the original behavior
4. Review all proposed changes for potential negative impacts before implementation
5. Document any complex behavior or functionality that is being preserved

When making changes:
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Document and justify any code removals or replacements
- Verify changes don't introduce regressions
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document any complex behavior that you need to preserve

## Configuration System Plan

### Phase 1: Consolidation
1. [ ] Merge `Config` classes from `src/utils/config.py` and `src/training/config.py` into `ConfigManager`
2. [ ] Update `TradeConfig` to inherit from `ConfigManager` and add trading-specific functionality
3. [ ] Remove redundant configuration loading code from individual modules
4. [ ] Standardize configuration file locations and naming

### Phase 2: Standardization
1. [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all configuration operations
2. [ ] Add validation for all configuration parameters
3. [ ] Create configuration schema documentation
4. [ ] Standardize configuration file format and structure

### Phase 3: Migration
1. [ ] Update all modules to use the centralized `ConfigManager`
2. [ ] Add backward compatibility layer for legacy configuration
3. [ ] Create migration guide for existing configurations
4. [ ] Add configuration versioning support

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for configuration system
2. [ ] Add configuration validation tests
3. [ ] Document all configuration parameters and their effects
4. [ ] Create examples for different configuration scenarios

### Implementation Details

#### Configuration File Structure
```json
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "environment": "development",
    "trading": {
        "bucket": "Scalping",
        "initial_capital": 100000.0,
        "max_positions": 50
    },
    "model": {
        "hidden_size": 512,
        "learning_rate": 0.0003,
        "batch_size": 128
    },
    "risk": {
        "max_btc_per_position": 10.0,
        "max_usd_per_position": 1000000.0,
        "max_volume_percentage": 0.05
    }
}
```

#### Error Handling
- Validation errors for required parameters
- Type checking for parameter values
- Range validation for numeric parameters
- Clear error messages with parameter context

#### Migration Strategy
1. Create new configuration files in standardized location
2. Add configuration version detection
3. Provide automatic migration for older versions
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

#### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for configuration loading and validation
2. Integration tests for configuration inheritance
3. Migration tests for version compatibility
4. Performance tests for configuration access

### Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1 consolidation
2. Create test cases for new configuration system
3. Update documentation with new configuration structure
4. Implement migration tools for existing configurations
